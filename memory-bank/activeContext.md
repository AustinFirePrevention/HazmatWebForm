# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initial setup and documentation of the hazardous materials management system. Establishing baseline understanding of the system's components, architecture, and requirements.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank documentation structure
- Documented core system architecture
- Mapped out component relationships
- Identified key technical patterns

## Active Considerations
1. System Structure
   - Form-based data collection
   - Material management workflow
   - Multi-language support implementation
   - Fee calculation integration

2. Component Architecture
   - Form section organization
   - Material card implementation
   - Modal usage patterns
   - Context-based state management

3. Data Management
   - JSON schema validation
   - Common chemicals database
   - Form state handling
   - Data verification processes

## Next Steps
1. Short Term
   - Review existing component implementations
   - Analyze validation patterns
   - Examine fee calculation logic
   - Study localization implementation

2. Medium Term
   - Identify potential optimizations
   - Review test coverage
   - Evaluate error handling
   - Assess user experience flow

3. Long Term
   - Consider scalability improvements
   - Plan future enhancements
   - Document best practices
   - Standardize patterns

## Active Decisions
1. Architecture
   - Using React with TypeScript
   - Component-based structure
   - Context for state management
   - Schema-based validation

2. Implementation
   - Form section modularity
   - Material card reusability
   - Multilingual support
   - Modal-based interactions

3. Development
   - Testing strategy
   - Documentation approach
   - Code organization
   - State management patterns

## Questions to Address
1. Technical
   - Optimization opportunities
   - Test coverage adequacy
   - Error handling completeness
   - State management efficiency

2. User Experience
   - Form flow effectiveness
   - Validation feedback clarity
   - Modal interaction patterns
   - Language switching behavior

3. Development
   - Component reuse potential
   - Documentation completeness
   - Testing strategy effectiveness
   - Code organization improvements
